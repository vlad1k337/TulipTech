I have to lock in on updating this README, lol.

Right now we have:
 - Red and Blue 12 ball autos working. Robot's intake is not able to get all 3 balls every time, but it's alright. 
 - TeleOP for 1 and 2 Players functioning. First player is controling driving, second one is responsible for the intake and shooting system.
 - PIDs are tuned _almost_ perfectly.

Started working on [Automatic Tunning](https://pedropathing.com/docs/pathing/tuning/automatic). 

- Maximum forward velocity, and forward deaccleration are set and look right.
- All the wood we have on a robot prevents it from strafing without shifting sideways. It looks like the wood bounces and skews the direction.

First commit. Robot works in TeleOP format, localization is correct

- Pinpoint localization added
- Added basic TeleOP mode, created originally using Dutch Bots old robot base
